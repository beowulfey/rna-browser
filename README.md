* Wormpaths data downloaded from Walhout website 2024-04-11
--> gene names, converting WormBase names to gene names (genes.csv)
--> pathway categories, four levels (four_level_categories.csv)
--> genes in each level (level_#_genes.csv, four files)

* Reorganized the four levels gene dataset so that the levels are row 1 and the genes are rows in each column
